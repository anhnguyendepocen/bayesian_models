## About the course

<div class="columns-2">
- (mostly self-contained) course of the basics of Bayesian methods
- focused on practical aspects of implementation (with R)
- lab format with (mostly) real-world psychological examples

## Replication crisis in psychology

- Only one third to one half of published psychological effects replicate: <a href=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716</a>
- Infamous frauds in the field of social psychology: <a href=http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2011/12/diederik-stapel.aspx>http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2011/12/diederik-stapel.aspx</a>

## Problems with Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) 1

- In NHST we claim to obtain significant effect if we obtain a *p-value* less than some threshold - usually .05
- What this *p-value* means?
- *P-value* should not be treated as a direct measure of evidence for our hypothesis
- We should rather use effect size value, e.g. Cohen's d. However it is not very intuitive.

## Problems with Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) 2

- How should we set up the threshold for *p-value* (p < .10, p < .05, p < .01, or p < .001)?
- With *p-value* we cannot prove that there is no difference, or that the correlation is negligible.
- Suppose you conducted 4 studies and each time you obtained some interesting effect. However, you failed to reject null hypothesis in Study 5. What should you do? 

## Why Bayesian statistics? 1

- Bayesian approach (BA) offers an alternative to classical approach
- BA allows to quantify degrees of uncertainty about every possible aspect of data analysis
- BA views probability in a subjective manner - *Bayesian p-value* can be interpreted as measure of confidence in some hypothesis
- BA does not constrain hypothesis testing to rejecting null hypothesis - it can be used to quantify evidence for no effect

## Why Bayesian statistics? 2

- BA allows to incorporate previous knowledge (e.g. from previous studies) in the process of hypothesis testing
- BA allows to deal quite easily with complex modeling tasks, and violated assumptions
- BA requires smaller sample sizes than classical approach
- BA is better in making predictions, and can advance us in the process of decision making

## Bayesian vs. frequentist approach | Interpretation of probability

- *Frequentist* - observed result from infinite series of trials performed or imagined under identical conditions

- *What is the probability that Poland will win the nearest FIFA World Cup?*

- *Bayesian* - probability is the researcher "degree of belief" before or after the data are observed

## Bayesian vs. frequentist approach | What is fixed and variable?

- *Frequentist* - data are iid random sample from continuous stream. Parameters are fixed by nature

- *Bayesian* - data are observed and so fixed by the sample generated. Parameters are unknown and described distributionally


## Bayesian vs. frequentist approach | What is fixed and variable?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(theta = 100*rbeta(1000, 5.2, 2))

  geom_vline(xintercept = 72, size=2, colour='red') +

  labs(x=expression(theta), y='Probability') +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size=16))
```


## Probability - brief, informal and intuitive recap

- Suppose we are interested in sleeping disorder (SD) among undergraduate students
- We ask a sample of students and find 8 undergrads who report SD, and 12 who don't report SD
- A ratio of undergrads with SD to undergrads without SD is then $\frac{8}{12} \approx 0.667$ - we called it odds
- Probability of $P(SD) = \frac{odds}{1+odds} = \frac{0.667}{1+0.667} \approx 0.40$

## Probability - recap

|           |  SD    |  no SD | *Total*  |
|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Psychology |   4    |  6     |  *10*    |
|Journalism |   2    |  8     |  *10*    |
| *Total*   |   *8*  |*12*    |  *20*    |


## Probability - recap

|           |  SD    |  no SD | *Total*  |
|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Psychology |   0.2  |  0.3   |  *0.5*   |
|Journalism |   0.1  |  0.4   |  *0.5*   |
| *Total*   |  *0.4* | *0.6*  |  *1.0*   |

- We call $P(SD = x)$ and $P(faculty = y)$ marginal probability
- We call $P(SD = x\ and\ faculty = y)$ joint probability
- Recall that if $P(SD = x) \times P(faculty = y) = P(SD = x\ and\ faculty = y)$ for every value of $x$ and $y$, the two variables are independent.
- Otherwise they are conditionally dependent

## Probability - recap

|           |  SD    |  no SD | *Total*  |
|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Psychology |   0.2  |  0.3   |  *0.5*   |
|Journalism |   0.1  |  0.4   |  *0.5*   |
| *Total*   |  *0.4* | *0.6*  |  *1.0*   |

- We call $P(SD = x | faculty = y)$ conditional probability
- $P(SD = x | faculty = y) = \frac{P(SD = x\ and\ faculty = y)}{P(faculty = y)}$
- $P(faculty = y | SD = x) = \frac{P(SD = x\ and\ faculty = y)}{P(SD = x)}$
- What is a conditional probability of SD for psychology undergrads?
- What is a conditional probability of SD for journalism undergrads?

## Bayes theorem

|           |  SD    |  no SD | *Total*  |
|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|Psychology |   0.2  |  0.3   |  *0.5*   |
|Journalism |   0.1  |  0.4   |  *0.5*   |
| *Total*   |  *0.4* | *0.6*  |  *1.0*   |

- Bayes theorem is a simple result that allows us to invert conditional probabilities, e.g. computing $P(SD = x | faculty = y)$ from $P(faculty = y | SD = x)$ without knowing a joint probability

- $P(faculty = y | SD = x) = \frac{P(SD = x | faculty = y) \times P(faculty = y)}{P(SD = x)}$
