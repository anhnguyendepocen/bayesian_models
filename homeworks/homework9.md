# Homework 9

In this homework you will analyze data collected by your teacher ;-).

The online experiment was conducted to check how behavioral helplessness training (BHT) affects
a very basic perception of relation between one's action and it's outcomes.
Quite novel findings suggest that experienced times of one's own action and it's sensory consequences
are attracted together - this is known as intentional binding and it is a mechanism
which is probably responsible for the sense of agency and selfefficacy.

Take a look at this short article where intentional binding was measured in similar manner:

In the study, intentional binding effects were measured among participants after BHT of different lengths
(3 conditions: 1. no BHT vs. 2. short - 2 trials - BHT vs. 3. long - 6 trials - BHT).

Different literature reviews suggest that control deprivation instigated by the BHT may lead both to decrease and/or increase in the sense of agency.
To know more about BHT check this article (specifically Study 2):

*Check how the scores of intentional binding differ between 3 experimental conditions. Higher scores
are interpreted as more sense of agency (more bias), while scores near 0 are interpreted as less sense of agency (more accurate perception).*
