# Homework 2 - eliciting Normal prior

- Read the short section from Jeff Gill book "Bayesian Methods" (you can find it in this folder).
- You can do the rest of this assignment in groups of 2 or 3 people.
- Try to think about some interesting psychological quantity that presumably takes Normal distribution, e.g. *what is the average IQ of people with depressive symptoms?* or *how long does mourning period last?*
- Prepare procedure for expert interviews that will use V-method and submit it for my acceptance.
- Conduct short interviews with at least 3 experts with knowledge in the selected matter (e.g. your instructors from other classes, known proffesional psychologists, etc.).
- Based on their answers formulate elicited prior distribution using linear regression.
- Present the obtained prior distribution on plot and describe it briefly.
- In the final report include also the procedure and interview protocol, i.e. how many people have you asked, who they were (without names).
