# Homework 6

This is just a follow up to the previous homework. Use the same data and the same model. Assess the convergence of the MCMC simulations.
- draw traceplots of the parameters
- use diagnostic tools to evaluate convergence (Geweke's convergence diagnostic, Heidelberger and Welch's convergence diagnostic, Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic)
- interpret the results
- assess the strength of autocorrelation of chains to check for poor mixing, report effective sample size for each parameter

As previously include your code, graphs, and text. You can use R Notebooks.
